# Best Practices

Use a centralized log system: Logs are an important source of information when building and maintaining event-driven systems. Use a centralized log system, such as Elasticsearch or Logstash, to collect, store and analyze logs from your NodeJS, Kafka and Fastify components.
Use appropriate logging levels: Use appropriate logging levels, such as INFO, WARNING and ERROR, to log events. This will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot issues.
Use idempotent producers: When producing events to Kafka, use idempotent producers to ensure that events are delivered in the order they were sent and to avoid duplicates.
Use a message schema: Use a message schema, such as Avro or JSON Schema, to define the structure and format of events that are produced and consumed by your system. This will help ensure data consistency and prevent compatibility issues.
Use a message broker with built-in security: Use a message broker, such as Kafka, that has built-in security features, such as encryption and authentication, to protect the sensitive data that is being transmitted between components.
Monitor and test your system: Regularly monitor and test your system to ensure that it is functioning as expected and to identify and resolve any potential issues.
