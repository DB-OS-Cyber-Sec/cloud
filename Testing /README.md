# Load Testing with k6, jq, and Matplotlib

## Overview

Load testing is a crucial part of software performance engineering that simulates user demand on a system to evaluate its performance under stress. This document outlines the tools used for load testing, specifically `k6`, `jq`, and `matplotlib`, and how they work together to facilitate the testing process and visualize the results.

## k6

[k6](https://k6.io/) is an open-source load testing tool designed for modern development. It allows developers to write test scripts in JavaScript, making it accessible and easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

### Key Features:

- **Scriptable Load Tests**: Write tests in JavaScript to simulate various user interactions and scenarios.
- **Realistic User Simulation**: Simulates thousands of virtual users (VUs) to stress-test applications and APIs.
- **Performance Metrics**: Captures and outputs a wide range of performance metrics, such as response times, error rates, and throughput.

### Installation and Execution:

To install `k6`, use the following command:

```bash
brew install k6
```

Run a load test with the command:

```bash
k6 run --out json=results.json loadtest.js
```

This command executes the load test defined in `loadtest.js` and outputs the results in JSON format to `results.json`.

## jq

[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. It is particularly useful for parsing, filtering, and transforming JSON data generated by various applications, including k6.

### Usage in Load Testing:

After executing a load test with k6, the resulting JSON data can be formatted and manipulated using jq. For example:

```bash
jq -s '.' results.json > formatted_results.json
```

This command combines the results into a single JSON array and saves it as `formatted_results.json`, making it easier to work with in subsequent analysis steps.

## Matplotlib

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used for plotting data and can effectively visualize performance metrics from load tests.

### Visualizing Load Test Results:

Once the JSON data is prepared and formatted, it can be visualized using matplotlib. A Python script (`plot.py`) can be written to read the formatted results, extract relevant metrics, and create plots that illustrate how the system performs under load.
